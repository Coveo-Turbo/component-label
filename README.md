# ComponentLabel

This component can be used to append a DOM-friendly label to a component that is missing it.

Disclaimer: This component was built by the community at large and is not an official Coveo JSUI Component. Use this component at your own risk.

## Getting Started

1. Install the component into your project.

```
npm i @coveops/component-label
```

2. Use the Component or extend it

Typescript:

```javascript
import { ComponentLabel, IComponentLabelOptions } from '@coveops/component-label';
```

Javascript

```javascript
const ComponentLabel = require('@coveops/component-label').ComponentLabel;
```

3. You can also expose the component alongside other components being built in your project.

```javascript
export * from '@coveops/component-label'
```

4. Or for quick testing, you can add the script from unpkg

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@coveops/component-label@latest/dist/index.min.js"></script>
```

> Disclaimer: Unpkg should be used for testing but not for production.

5. Include the component in your template as follows:

Place the component in your markup:

```html
<div class="CoveoComponentLabel"></div>
```

## Options

The following options can be configured:

| Option | Required | Type | Default | Notes |

| `content` | No | string | `label` | Content of the label. |
| `contentType` | No | string | `text` | Specifies the content type of the label. Valid values are `header` or `text`. |

## Extending

export interface IExtendedComponentLabelOptions extends IComponentLabelOptions {}

export class ExtendedComponentLabel extends ComponentLabel {}
```
